#   Three Patterns - 
    FrequencyCounter Pattern
    Multiple Pointers Pattern
    Sliding Window Pattern

    Divide and Conquer Pattern



# Frequency Counter Pattern
    const arr = [1,2,3,1,2,34,45,1];
    const str = "123234asdasfdafdssa"
    const num = 123232
    both passed strings are same or not
    both arrays are same or not
    are there any duplicates 

    const obj = {
        "1": 1,
        "2": 3
         ...
    }    


#   Multiple Pointers Pattern
    [1,2,3,4,5,7,4,5,7,7,7]; // 6
